Here are some tips to get you started:\\nCapture a familiar subject or scene from an unexpected angle. Get up close and let a face cover the entire frame, or make a puppy look large by shooting from ground-level as she stares down. Find a high vantage point to show the wider context of a festival scene or bustling market.\\nUse geometry to your advantage. Look for graphic lines — in bridges or telephone wires — that converge to a vanishing point in your composition. Find a new way to capture patterns in everyday places, like the wheels of bicycles lined up in a rack, or symmetrical bricks in an unruly garden.\\nPlay an eye trick. Defy gravity with simple editing, like rotating the frame. Recruit a friend to make a well-timed leap, that, when rotated, looks like they’re flying through air. Or turn a dandelion into a human-size parasol by playing with scale and distance.\\n\\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPperspective hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

So when he decided to create a collection inspired by his home state, he and his team took up a month-long residency in the West Texas town of Marfa. “I already had a strong vision of Texas glamour and Marfa gave me the space to flush out that idea.” That spring/ summer 2019 collection was shown last weekend at New York Fashion Week (@nyfw), and the Texas inspiration shined bright. “Marfa sunsets ignited my use of bright color,” says Brandon. “Pink and red have always been colors I used and this season it was about amplifying those.” Other Texas hat-tips were silver belts and silk scarves knotted like bandannas — and cowboy hats, carried down the runway in clear boxes with handles. At the end of the show, Brandon’s grandmother joined him on the carpet. “It felt like it was full circle to bring her out for this show,” he says.\\n\\nCheck out our story and IGTV channel as we go behind the scenes with Brandon and his team leading up to #NYFW. 👠'}, {'img_url': 'https://scontent-sin6-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/6981e9ebdd84a3a0b82c934fe9f2a586/5C3BD202/t51.2885-15/e35/40344713_104880087083767_4182237449620166563_n.jpg', 'comment_count': 5514, 'like_count': 664429, 'text': 'Photo by @exploringwithazhar\\nA window into #WHPdailylife on a crowded train in Mumbai.'}, {'img_url': 'https://scontent-sin6-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/28ecb5532b90d27b5d936b329cf16402/5C1F5A53/t51.2885-15/e35/40535718_321093198650462_5061251310611191279_n.jpg', 'comment_count': 4032, 'like_count': 585944, 'text': 'Photo by @thebookfamilyrogerson\\n“Weekend breakfasts are a civilized affair in the Rogerson household,” writes Melissa Rogerson (@thebookfamilyrogerson) in her caption. “We have papers and books, and music on the radio.
